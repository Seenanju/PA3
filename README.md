# Experiment 3: Python Data Analysis (Pandas)


#### PROBLEM 1: Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P1.py 
Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations: 
- Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas
- Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars. 
#### PROBLEM 2: Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P2.py 
Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and indexing operations. 
- Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7…) of cars. 
- Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’. 
- How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have? 
- Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.
